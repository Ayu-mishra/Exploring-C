/******************************************************************************

C.(1) A semiconductor manufacturer sells three types of 
microprocessors: 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit. It differentiates between three types of customers: industry, government, and 
university. It has the following discount policy that depends on 
the type of microprocessor, the amount of order, and the type 
of customer: 
For 32-bit microprocessor, if the order is for less than Rs. 
50,000, allow 5 % discount to industrial customers and 6.5 % 
discount to the government agencies. If the order is Rs. 50,000 
or more, a discount of 7.5 % and 8.5 % respectively is given 
to the industrial customers and the government agencies. A   
discount of 10 % is given to both industrial customers and 
government agencies if the order is more than Rs. 1,00,000. 
Universities get a discount of 7.5 % irrespective of the amount 
of order. 
For 16-bh microprocessors, no discount is given for orders less 
than Rs 10,000. For orders of Rs 10,000 or more, 5 % discount 
is given to the industrial customers and universities, and 6 % 
discount is given to the government agencies. 
For 8-bit microprocessors, a flat discount of 10 % is given to 
all the three types of customers for any order. 

Write a program that reads the type of the customer, the type 
of the product, the amount of the order, and prints the net 
amount payable by the customer.
